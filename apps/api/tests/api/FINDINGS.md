## GROUP 1 — Auth Endpoints (9 Jun 2026)

### F-01 HIGH — OAuth callback path mismatch
- File: auth.controller.ts lines 1047 and 1123
- Callbacks registered at double-auth path
- Initiate handlers advertise single-auth redirect_uri
- Real Google/Microsoft redirect returns 401 — OAuth login never completes
- Fix required before portal goes live
- Status: FIXED IN CODE (9 Jun 2026) — callbacks re-registered at the single-auth
  path (/oauth/{google,microsoft}/callback). Pending verification against the live
  deployment after Vercel redeploy.

### F-02 LOW — POST /auth/logout returns 204 not 200
- Inconsistent with the rest of the API envelope
- Endpoint correct; certification test aligned to 204
- Document only — no fix required
- Status: ACCEPTED (no fix)

### F-03 INFO — POST /auth/refresh not implemented
- Substituted with GET /auth/session for token validation
- Implement before mobile client support
- Status: OPEN (deferred)
